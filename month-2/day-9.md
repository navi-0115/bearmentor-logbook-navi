# Month 2 Day 9: Programming Languages, Algorithm, Data Structure

it's essential to understand the basics of Computational Thinking (CT) as the foundation of programming. Computational Thinking is not coding or programming itself, but a process of telling the computer what to do. Programming involves instructing a computer on what actions to take and how to perform them.

## Computational Thinking

Computational Thinking (CT) involves using a set of techniques and approaches to solve problems. It helps in breaking down complex problems into manageable parts.

### Components of Computational Thinking

1. **Abstraction**: Formulating the problem.
2. **Automation**: Expressing the solution.
3. **Analysis**: Executing and evaluating the solution.

### Practical Approach

To solve a complex problem using computational thinking:
1. Break down the complex problem into smaller, manageable parts.
2. Identify similar problems solved in the past and apply those solutions to the current problem, focusing on the important details.
3. Design steps to solve each smaller problem.

## Algorithms

An algorithm is a set of processes or rules to solve problems using logical steps.

### Parts of an Algorithm

1. **Input**: Data or rules received from external sources such as a keyboard, mouse, microphone, sensor, camera, or touch screen.
2. **Process**: Steps, functions, or methods performed within the system, like adding, dividing, converting, displaying, or searching data.
3. **Output**: Results produced and sent to external sources such as monitors, heaters, speakers, or graphics devices.

Algorithms can be designed using pseudocode or a flowchart, and the standard notations of each should be known.

### Algorithm Components

- **Constants**: Data values that do not change.
- **Variables**: Data values that can change during program execution.
- **Assignment**: Operation of assigning a new value to a variable, overwriting the current value.
- **Scope**: 
  - *Local variables*: Accessible only within the loop, procedure, or class they are created in.
  - *Global variables*: Accessible from any point in a program.
- **Declaration**: Specifying a variable's name, data type, and memory location.

### Building Blocks of Algorithms

1. **Sequencing**: The specific order in which instructions are performed.
2. **Selection**: Making decisions or asking questions within the algorithm.
3. **Iteration**: Repeating steps in the algorithm.
   ## `do-while` Loop
    The `do-while` loop guarantees that the loop body will be executed at least once before the condition is checked.
    ### Explanation
    In a `do-while` loop, the loop will execute the statements inside the loop body first, then check the condition. If the condition is true, it will continue to execute; if false, it will stop after the first execution.

    ## while loop
    `Behavior`: The while loop will only execute the statements inside the loop if the condition is true.
    `Use Case`: Use a while loop when you want to repeat a block of code only if a certain condition is true.

4. **Logical Reasoning**: Applying rules to solve problems.

### Illustrating an Algorithm

- **Flowchart**: Diagram representing a set of instructions or processes.
- **Pseudocode**: Describing a set of instructions in plain English.
- **Actual Code**: Implementing the algorithm directly in code.

## Data Structures and Types

Data in a computer program is organized using data structures and data types.

- **Static Data Structures**: Fixed in size.
- **Dynamic Data Structures**: Can grow or shrink.
- **Mutable Data Structures**: Allow data to be edited, deleted, or moved.
- **Immutable Data Structures**: Data cannot be changed once set.

## Implementing Computational Thinking in Programming

A computer program processes input and produces output:

- **Input**: Data from the user or the computer.
- **Process**: Programmed by the user or another program.
- **Output**: Data shown to the user or the computer.

### Programming Steps

1. Think
2. Research
3. Plan
4. Write or Code
5. Validate or Check
6. Test or Break
7. Debug or Fix
8. Deploy or Publish
9. Refactor or Refine
10. Iterate or Repeat

## Interpreter vs Compiler

### Interpreter

An interpreter reads and executes code line by line. This makes it easy to debug but slower during execution.

- **Example**: Python and JavaScript use interpreters. When you run a Python script, the Python interpreter reads and executes each line one by one.

### Compiler

A compiler translates the entire code into machine language (binary code) before running it. This makes execution faster but can be harder to debug, and the resulting code is platform-specific.

- **Example**: C and C++ use compilers. When you compile a C program, the compiler translates the entire source code into machine code, creating an executable file that runs quickly.
